# Food-delivery-App-webpage
its a food delivery app webpage in which showcases data from backend to frontend to user to see.
Frontend is done by React
In backend i have created api that fetches the data and displays it in frontend for user to see.
its a basic food delivery app, which showcases a diverse menu of items to search and select using the search functionality by using query paramaters.
i haven't added any payement gateway like stripe as its a basic model of a food delivery app that showcases my command over backend and frontend operations.
